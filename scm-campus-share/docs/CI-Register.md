## 1. Introduction

This document constitutes the authoritative Configuration Item Register for the Campus Share Academic Resource Sharing Platform project. As the formal catalog of all artifacts under configuration management control, it serves as the single source of truth for asset identification, version tracking, and relationship management throughout the project lifecycle. The register implements the requirements established in Section 2 of the Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP), providing systematic identification and classification of all significant project deliverables.

Configuration Items represent the fundamental building blocks of our software system, each requiring formal control, review procedures, and change management oversight. This register enables comprehensive traceability by documenting what exists, where it exists, how it relates to other components, and how it evolves through successive project phases. By maintaining this structured inventory, the project team ensures that all modifications are deliberate, documented, and reversible, thereby preserving software integrity while facilitating controlled evolution.

The scope of this register encompasses the complete spectrum of project artifacts, from foundational documentation and source code implementations to configuration specifications and Software Configuration Management deliverables. Each registered item undergoes continuous monitoring through established change control procedures, with status updates reflected in this document to maintain currency with the project's actual state. This systematic approach supports not only development activities but also auditing, baseline establishment, and release management processes.

## 2. Configuration Item Identification Methodology

The identification of Configuration Items follows a rigorous methodology based on established criteria documented in Section 2 of the SCMP.

An artifact qualifies as a Configuration Item when it exhibits one or more of the following characteristics

● It constitutes a primary project deliverable with direct contribution to platform functionality or documentation

● Requires formal team review and approval prior to modification

● Establishes dependencies with other components or serves as a dependency for other artifacts

● Represents a baseline component requiring preservation for historical reference

● Provides essential support for build, deployment, or maintenance operations.

The identification process employs progressive elaboration, recognizing that project artifacts emerge at different stages of the development lifecycle. Rather than attempting exhaustive identification at project inception, the methodology provides for continuous evaluation and registration as artifacts reach maturity. This phased approach ensures that the register remains manageable while accurately reflecting the evolving project landscape. Each newly identified CI undergoes evaluation against the established criteria, receives appropriate classification and identification, and enters the formal control regime documented herein.

Categorization provides the organizational framework for CI management, grouping artifacts by functional similarity and management requirements. The established categories, Documentation, Source Code, Configuration and Build, Database Schema, and SCM Artifacts, facilitate targeted management practices appropriate to each artifact type. This categorization enables efficient retrieval, consistent application of naming conventions, and appropriate application of change control procedures based on artifact characteristics and project role.

## 3. Naming Convention and Identification Standards

A standardized naming convention ensures unambiguous identification and consistent reference across all project activities. Each Configuration Item receives a unique identifier following the pattern [CATEGORY]-[SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER], where the three letter category code denotes the CI type and the sequential number provides unique identification within that category. The category codes establish clear classification

● DOC for Documentation

● SRC for Source Code

● CFG for Configuration and Build

● DB for Database Schema

● SCM for Software Configuration Management artifacts.

This formal identifier remains constant throughout the CI's lifecycle, providing a stable reference point even as file locations or repository structures evolve. In parallel, each CI maintains its actual file path and name within the version control system, creating a dual identification system that supports both formal SCM processes and practical development activities. The naming convention facilitates automated tracking, reporting, and impact analysis while preventing identifier collisions that could compromise traceability and control.

The sequential numbering within each category follows chronological registration order, with numbers assigned consecutively as new CIs are identified. This approach provides inherent information about when a CI entered the configuration management system relative to others in its category. Gaps in numbering are intentionally avoided to prevent confusion, with retired numbers remaining permanently associated with their original CI even if that CI transitions to archived status. This systematic approach ensures that every project artifact, from the most critical source code module to supporting documentation, receives consistent, unambiguous identification.

### 4.3 Configuration and Build Configuration Items

Configuration and Build Configuration Items govern the construction, dependency management, and environmental configuration of the Campus Share platform. These CIs define how source code transforms into executable applications, manage external dependencies, and establish environment-specific settings. While often less visible than source code CIs, these items critically influence build reproducibility, deployment consistency, and development environment standardization.

| CFG-001 | Go Module Definition               | /go.mod         | Go module definition file declaring the module path, Go version requirements, and all direct dependencies for the Campus Share backend. This file serves as the foundation for dependency management, ensuring reproducible builds across diverse development environments. Specifications include minimum Go version (1.21) and comprehensive listing of required packages including Gin web framework, GORM ORM, JWT library, AWS SDK, PostgreSQL driver, and testing utilities. The module definition enables version pinning, dependency graph resolution, and vendor directory management. | Version 1.0 established December 22, 2025 with initial dependency specification. | Active | Backend Development Team    | None                | Dependency additions require team review, compatibility testing, and security vulnerability assessment.              |
| CFG-002 | Go Dependency Checksum File        | /go.sum         | Cryptographic checksum file ensuring integrity and preventing dependency tampering within the Go module system. Automatically generated and maintained by Go's toolchain, this file contains SHA-256 checksums for all module dependencies at specific versions. The checksums provide verification that downloaded dependencies match exactly those used during development, preventing supply chain attacks and ensuring build consistency across environments.                                                                                                                               | Auto-generated with dependency changes; initial establishment December 22, 2025. | Active | Go toolchain (auto-managed) | go.mod (CFG-001)    | Automatically updated by Go toolchain; manual editing prohibited to maintain integrity.                              |
| CFG-003 | Git Ignore Configuration           | /.gitignore     | Git ignore rules specifying files and directories excluded from version control. This configuration prevents accidental inclusion of generated artifacts, sensitive information, environment-specific files, and development tool artifacts. Coverage includes build outputs (binaries, executables), environment configuration files (.env), IDE-specific metadata, log files, local database instances, dependency caches, and temporary files. The ignore rules ensure repository cleanliness while protecting sensitive credentials from exposure.                                          | Version 1.0 established December 22, 2025 with comprehensive exclusion patterns. | Active | Development Team            | None                | Standard change control process with emphasis on security implications of pattern modifications.                     |
| CFG-004 | Environment Configuration Template | /.env.example   | Template file demonstrating required environment variables and their formats without exposing actual credentials. This documentation artifact guides developers in configuring their local environments by showing variable names, expected formats, and example values.

### 4.4 Database Schema Configuration Items

Database Schema Configuration Items define the persistent data structures and relationships within the Campus Share platform. Unlike traditional SQL-based schema definitions, this project utilizes GORM model-driven schema management where code definitions automatically generate corresponding database structures. This approach maintains schema definitions within the source code repository, ensuring synchronization between application logic and data persistence layers.

Definition includes table structures, column specifications, data types, constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints), indexes for performance optimization, and relationship definitions (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). Schema evolution is managed through GORM's AutoMigrate functionality, which automatically creates or modifies database structures to match model definitions while preserving existing data where possible. | Version 1.0 established December 22, 2025; updated December 29, 2025 with social feature additions. | Active | Backend Development Team | GORM library, PostgreSQL database | Schema changes require migration planning, data preservation strategies, and comprehensive testing across environments. |

### 4.5 Software Configuration Management Artifacts

Software Configuration Management Artifacts constitute the meta-documentation governing the configuration management process itself. These CIs provide the framework, records, and verification mechanisms that ensure all other Configuration Items are properly managed throughout their lifecycle. As both documentation and process artifacts, they require meticulous maintenance to support auditability, traceability, and process compliance.
