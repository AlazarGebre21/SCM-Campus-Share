# Change Request Form

## Basic Information
**Change Request ID:** CR-05
**Title:** Implement Backend API for Resource Upload and Management  
**Requested By:** Afomia 
**Date Requested:** 2025-12-29  
**Priority:** High  

---

## Change Details
**Description of Change:**
Implement the complete backend API for resource upload, retrieval, update, and deletion functionality. This includes:
1. Create RESTful endpoints for resource CRUD operations
2. Implement file upload handling with S3/MinIO integration
3. Add search and filtering capabilities for resources
4. Implement tagging system for resource categorization
5. Add access control based on resource sharing levels (public/university/department/course/private)

**Reason for Change:**
This is a core requirement for the Campus Share platform to function as an academic resource sharing system. Without resource management capabilities, users cannot upload, share, or access academic materials. This change establishes the foundational functionality that the entire platform depends upon.

**Affected Configuration Items (CIs):**
- SRC-001: Main Application Entry Point - Add resource route registration
- SRC-008: Resource Model - Core data structure for resources
- SRC-013: Tag Model - Resource categorization system
- SRC-019: Resource Handler - HTTP handlers for resource operations
- SRC-029: Resource Service - Business logic for resource management
- SRC-040: Cloud Storage Integration Module - File upload/download handling
- DOC-003: API Integration Guide - Document resource endpoints
- DOC-005: Complete API Reference - Add resource API documentation
