## Change Details

**Description of Change:**
Update the user interface across all frontend components to improve visual consistency, usability, accessibility, and responsiveness. This includes:

1. Redesign layouts for better user flow and mobile responsiveness
2. Update styling using latest Tailwind CSS utilities and custom themes
3. Enhance interactive elements like buttons, forms, and modals for better accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
4. Improve component reusability and consistency across pages
5. Update assets and icons for modern aesthetic

All frontend UI components, pages, and layouts will be affected by this comprehensive redesign.

**Reason for Change:**
The current frontend UI has inconsistencies in design, limited mobile optimization, and outdated styling that impacts user experience. This update will align the interface with modern web design standards, improve accessibility compliance, and enhance overall platform adoption by making it more intuitive and visually appealing for academic users.
